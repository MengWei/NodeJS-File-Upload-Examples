## Ajax style file upload examples in NodeJS

* [SwfUpload](http://swfupload.org) - Flash supported
* [Uploadify](http://www.uploadify.com) - Flash supported
* [Valums Ajax File-Uploader](http://valums.com/ajax-upload/) - HTML5

I have implemented three basic working file upload examples in NodeJS. Each option has it's pros and cons so it's up to you
to decide which is the most suitable for your project.

*See READMEs in each directory for more information on each option.*
